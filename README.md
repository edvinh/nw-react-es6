# nw-react-es6
Work in progress. A small Google Calendar app built for testing 
out NW (formerly known as node-webkit), React, ES6, and material-ui amongst other nice things.
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/)
* [NW](http://nwjs.io/)

### How do I run it?
To run the program you need to download the nw.js binary and paste it into a new /nw/ folder in the root directory of this program. Then simply download the npm modules (```npm init```), build it with ```gulp``` and run ```npm start```.
